# LB Planner

LB Planner is an application designed to help students plan and organize their self-taught studying by tracking and managing their modules. It provides an easy-to-use interface that allows users to stay on top of their academic goals. For more information, please visit our [website](https://projekte.tgm.ac.at/lb-planner/).

## Compile Steps

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure that you have [FVM](https://fvm.app/docs/getting_started/installation/) installed on your machine.
3. Navigate to the project directory in the terminal.
4. Run `fvm use` to select the Flutter version.
5. Run `flutter pub get` to install the required dependencies.
6. To build the application for release on macOS, run `flutter build macos --release --no-sound-null-safety`. The built application can be found in the `build/macos/Build/Products/Release/` directory.
7. To build the application for release on Windows, run `flutter build windows --release --no-sound-null-safety`. The built application can be found in the `build\windows\runner\Release\` directory.
8. To build the application for release on Linux, run `flutter build linux --release --no-sound-null-safety`. The built application can be found in the `build/linux/release/bundle/` directory.

Note: LB Planner uses `--no-sound-null-safety` because some of the third-party packages used in the app do not yet support Flutter's null safety feature. If you encounter any issues while compiling or running the application, please refer to the official [Flutter documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs) or the [FVM documentation](https://fvm.app) for troubleshooting tips.
